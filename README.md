Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project to classify iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Using the classic Iris dataset, we explore, preprocess, visualize, and build a classification model.

Dataset

The project utilizes the Iris dataset, which includes:

Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width

Target: species (categorical)

Project Workflow

Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset for patterns and distributions.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values (if any), scale features, and prepare the data for modeling.

Model Training: Implement a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines).

Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy and performance using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.

Visualization: Provide insights using plots to highlight patterns and model performance.
